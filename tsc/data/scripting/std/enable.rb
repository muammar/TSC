module Std

  # This module adds the methods Sprite#disable and Sprite#enable to
  # the core sprite class. By fiddling with a sprite’s position these
  # methods can take a sprite effectively out of game so that it
  # doesn’t even block as if it were just invisible.
  #
  # Under the hood, the sprite is moved outside the visible level
  # area while the original position is remembered. On calling #enable,
  # the original position is restored on the sprite.
  module Enable

    # Take the sprite off the game. Apart from position
    # all information remains set.

    end

    # Restore the sprite and optionally set its massivity to +mass+;
    # if that is unset, it remains at whatever massivity it was before.
